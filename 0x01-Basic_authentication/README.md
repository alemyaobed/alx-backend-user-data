# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Back-end | Authentication

### Background Context
In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement Basic Authentication on a simple API.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic Authentication system. Instead, you should use a module or framework that handles it for you (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth for Python-Flask). However, for learning purposes, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what authentication means
- Learn about Base64 encoding
- Encode a string in Base64
- Grasp the concept of Basic Authentication
- Learn how to send the Authorization header

### Introduction
In this project, we will delve into the fundamentals of authentication and build a simple API that utilizes Basic Authentication. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing secure back-end systems.

### Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that only authorized entities can access protected resources.

### Base64 Encoding
Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into an ASCII string format. It is commonly used to encode data in a way that can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols such as HTTP.

### Basic Authentication
Basic Authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g., a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. It uses the Authorization header to transmit the encoded credentials.

### Authorization Header
The Authorization header is a component of the HTTP header that contains the credentials for authenticating a user agent with a server. In Basic Authentication, it includes the word "Basic" followed by a space and the Base64-encoded credentials.

### Conclusion
By completing this project, you will have a better understanding of the authentication process and the steps involved in implementing Basic Authentication in an API. This knowledge is essential for building secure applications and understanding the importance of using established frameworks and modules in real-world scenarios.
